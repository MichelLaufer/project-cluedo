Build a piece of Cluedo

The fifth week's project at the Technigo boot camp was to create a piece of the famous board game Cluedo. The focus on this project was to practise objects and arrays and also to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript. The user should be able to click on three decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room. Then there should also be a button to reveal the mystery.

I used JavaScript to create functions for when the user clicks on the deck of cards and the button. I added a fourth deck of cards to show a random "time of the day", e.g. "morning" or "afternoon".
